Hello friends if you found this github page congrats!!!

From now on you don't need to create your own codes for the front-end-lab in our 3-1 semester you can download the files from this page but please follow the following points

##Always change the name of the files after you have downloaded to avoid getting caught ##Check for name is the code like in MyBlog.html change the name immediately after you have downloaded

Unit-1:
    HTML-5:
        new Semantic tags
        multimedia elements
        graphic elements --(svg, canvas)
        web storage
        web workers
        geoloacations
        drag and drop


####### Note #############: 
To run web workers use nodejs you can download it from https://nodejs.org/

To check if the install was successful you can use the command: node -v

TO run files open command prompt in the folder where the file you want to run is located
Then create server using the following command:
npm install -g http-server

Then start server with the following command:
http-server

--Then you will get a lot of things on display click on one of the links listed.

--Then a web page will be opened in the browser with all the files in that directory,

--now click on the file you want to run, wola! you learned how to run a file on nodejs, note that this is not everything this is just the introduction
