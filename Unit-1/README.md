Hello friends if you found this github page congrats!!!

From now on you don't need to create your own codes for the front-end-lab in our 3-1 semester you can download the files from this page but please follow the following points

##Always change the name of the files after you have downloaded to avoid getting caught
##Check for name is the code like in MyBlog.html change the name immediately after you have downloaded
